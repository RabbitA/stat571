1.  Montgomery 3.3

One-way ANOVA

Source      DF      SS      MS      F       P
Factor       3   36.15       ?      ?       ?
Error        ?       ?       ?      ?
Total       19  196.04

2.  Montgomery 3.22 (skip part d)

a) Do the three circuits have the same response time?

> dat = read.delim("~/work/stat571/hw02/3.22.dat")
> dat$circuit = factor(dat$circuit)
> amod = aov(response ~ circuit, data=dat)
> amod.sum = unlist(summary(amod))
> amod.sum['Pr(>F)1']
     Pr(>F)1 
0.0004023258 

P << Î± = 0.01, so reject H0 (no difference), response times are different 

b) Tukey's test

> TukeyHSD(amod, conf.level=0.99)
  Tukey multiple comparisons of means
    99% family-wise confidence level

Fit: aov(formula = response ~ circuit, data = dat)

$circuit
     diff        lwr       upr     p adj
2-1  11.4   2.123163 20.676837 0.0023656
3-1  -2.4 -11.676837  6.876837 0.6367043
3-2 -13.8 -23.076837 -4.523163 0.0005042

c) graphical comparison

e) Circuit 3 seems to have the lowest reponse time which would be desirable
for a shutoff valve.

f) 

> plot(residuals(lm))

Shows a random distribuion of residuals, so, yes, basic analysis of 
variance assumptions are satisfied.
